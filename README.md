# VPS_buddy
this is a simple script to help you to quickly install tools on your VPS

**this script is written by a noob and it is the collection of tools from the early days of starting bug bounty some of them are popular and some of them don't. or maybe I had just used them once and I uploaded this in here to make things easier for myself**

git clone https://github.com/moein9/VPS_buddy.git

chmod +x VPS_buddy.sh
./VPS_buddy.sh
```
